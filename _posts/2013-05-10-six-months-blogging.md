<p>Hey guys! Yesterday, the blog was 6 months old. Launched in <a href="http://hugogiraudel.com/2012/11/09/redesign-blog/">November 9th 2012</a> as a quick and dirty plateform to drop some posts when I get time, now built on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> and <a href="https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/hugogiraudel.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>, I have to say I am pretty happy with what I have done so far with this.</p>
<p>I take this article as an opportunity to make some kind of assessment. Any comment appreciated of course. ;)</p>

<h3>About the blog</h3>
<p>In 6 months, I've released exactly 30 articles (this is 31st) including 3 specials: 2 interviews (<a href="http://hugogiraudel.com/2013/04/23/interview-by-clement-osternaud/">one of me from Cl√©ment Osternaud</a> and <a href="http://hugogiraudel.com/2013/03/11/interview-manoela-ilic/">one of Manoela Ilic from me</a>) and a guest post (<a href="http://hugogiraudel.com/2013/02/04/css-gradients/">from Ana Tudor</a>).</p>
<p>The most successful article is definitely <a href="http://hugogiraudel.com/2013/02/04/css-gradients/">Dig deep into CSS linear gradients</a> (the guest post from Ana Tudor) with more than 30,000 viewed pages and 32 comments. Then it is a very old one: <a href="http://hugogiraudel.com/2012/11/13/less-to-sass/">Why I switched from LESS to Sass</a> with over 12,000 viewed pages for 29 comments. The third most read article is <a href="http://hugogiraudel.com/2013/04/30/css-aha-moment/">My CSS aha moment</a> with about 11,000 viewed pages and 30 comments. Note that other articles like <a href="http://hugogiraudel.com/2013/04/08/css-alternative-select/">Why a CSS alternative to the select element is not possible</a>, <a href="http://hugogiraudel.com/2013/01/28/float-down/">Simulate float: down</a> and <a href="http://hugogiraudel.com/2013/04/04/css-grid-layout/">Future of CSS layout: Grid</a> has been very welcomed as well.</p>
<p>All articles have drawn more than <strong>82,000 unique visitors</strong> for about <strong>150,000 viewed pages</strong>. The average visit duration is close to one minute, and the number of page per visit is around 1.4.</p>

<h3>About you</h3>
<blockquote class="pull-quote--right">Chrome gets more than 60% of the browser share.</blockquote>
<p>Enough about me, let's talk about you: <strong>28% of users come from United States</strong>, 8% come from United Kingdom, then a little more than 7% from France.</p>
<p>Regarding browser, I'm a lucky bastard: <strong>Chrome gets more than 60% of the browser share</strong> on my site, then it's Firefox with 17.5%, and then Safari with 16%. Internet Explorer comes further with 1.8%.</p>

<p>About <strong>14% users are reading articles on their mobile phone</strong> (cf. fig 2). and 7 out of 10 of them use an Apple phone. The 3 others use Android (I'm in).</p>
<p>The most important traffic source is definitely <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> (actually t.co), then it's <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> and then <a href="http://tympanus.com/codrops/">Codrops</a>. A little further behind, we have <a href="http://sidebar.io">Sidebar.io</a>, <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> and <a href="http://css-tricks.com">CSS-Tricks</a>.</p>

<h2>What's next? <a href="#">#</a></h2>
<p>You tell me. Is there anything you'd like to see?</p>
<p>I'm thinking about adding an excerpt for each blog post to the home page. I think some people asked for it. My problem with this is that excerpt are a pain in the ass to do if you want to do it right, and when generated, it generally sucks. I'll see if I can come up with a decent solution.</p>
<p>I would also like to add a small banner for <a href="http://browserhacks.com">Browserhacks</a> in the sidebar. I'll work that out anytime soon.</p>
<p>Anyway, thank you all for reading. That's what keeps me writing. ;)</p>
