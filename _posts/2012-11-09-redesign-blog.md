<section>
<p>Hi guys! As you can see, I have big news. I've changed a few things on hugogiraudel.com in order to make it look like a little bit more aesthetic and/or professionnal. What do you say?</p>
<p>Actually, this is the very recent redesign of <a href="http://daverupert.com" title="Dave Rupert" target="blank">http://daverupert.com</a> (nice job by the way) who led me to do such a task. You see, for months (almost years!) and I don't really know why, I thought I had to manage a CMS like WordPress or whatever to handle a blog. But why bother? Simple HTML/CSS pushing on a server and this is done, right?</p>

<section id="what-for">
<h2>A blog, what for? <a href="#what-for" class="section-anchor">#</a></h2>
<p>This is a good question since I'm not planning on heavy blogging. You may know I'm a writer for <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/" title="Codrops">Codrops</a> and hell I'm proud of it. Anyway, it takes me a good amount of time, so I won't be able to post things everyday here.</p>
<p>However, I really wanted a place on the internet to talk about some things I can't write about at Codrops. I'm still talking about web, don't worry. Things like tools, personal experiences, stuff about my work, my side projects, or whatever.</p>

<section id="functioning">
<h2>How does this work? <a href="#functioning" class="section-anchor">#</a></h2>
<p>Actually this is very simple for now, but I'm planning on a few things to improve my workflow in a not so far future. As of today, I'm writing my stuff on Sublime Text in a template file, and then I push them to the server with a FTP client.</p>
<p>There is no JavaScript (nor jQuery), no plugin, no PHP and no database. Only a tiny little stylesheet. Which means the site is fast, and it matters a lot to me, especially when it comes to mobile browsing.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'd like to be able to manage things a little better. For example, I'd like to write my articles in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" title="Markdown">Markdown</a> instead of regular HTML. Also, depending on either I post a lot of code snippets or not I may want to add <a href="http://prismjs.com/" title="Prism">Prism.js</a> for the syntax highlighting.</p>
<p>I'm currently documenting myself on <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a> to be able to get rid of the FTP client and manage everything on an upper level, but it will take some time before I make the switch.</p>

<section id="design">
<h2>About the design <a href="#design" class="section-anchor">#</a></h2>
<p>I know this may look a little flat but I wanted it to be. It's minimalist to focus on the content and nothing else. No fancy buttons, no complex multi-columns layout, no heavy CSS transitions, etc. It's a blog made with the content, for the content. This is why the font-size is huge, the line-height is important, there is a lot of space, and so on.</p>
<p>But I may improve the design over the time of course. :)</p>
</section>
<section id="to-do">
<h2>What's next? <a href="#to-do" class="section-anchor">#</a></h2>
<p>Honestly I don't know. Blogging when I have time and things to say. Maybe a contact page or something.</p>
<p>For now, I'm not planning on adding a comments system because I don't think there is much need for it. Most people won't take the time to comment anyway, and those who would do can still catch me on <a href="http://twitter.com/hugoGiraudel" title="Twitter">Twitter</a>. But if one day I feel like I should allow users to comment, I may think about <a href="http://disqus.com/" title="Disqus">Disqus</a>. Mainly because I don't want to spend hours doing PHP stuff on this.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you find any bug or have any suggestion, please catch me on GTalk or Twitter.</p>
